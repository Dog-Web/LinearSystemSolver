# LinearSystemSolver
Linear System Solver(Numerically Stable)
A all new numerically stable method for computing solutions to linear system. In Gaussian elimination, a pivot is to be selected in each column for elimination. Pivot selection needs to be such that it has the highest quality in terms of accuracy. 
Quality function for element (i,j) is defined as |A(i,j)|/max{|Ai|}.
